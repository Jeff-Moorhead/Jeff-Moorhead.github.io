          <h4>Hello world,</h4>
          <div class="basic-info">
            <p>Thanks for visiting! My name is Jeff Moorhead. I am a student at Drew University majoring in mathematics with
              minors in French, physics, and computer science. My first programming language was Python, which I learned
              during the summer of 2017. During the Fall semester of 2017 I took Intro to Java, and later applied to master's
              programs in computer science. In 2018, I plan on pursuing a master's degree to prepare for a career in the
              tech industry. Hopefully, in a few years, I will also be able to pursue a Ph.D. in either mathematics or computer
              science. This webpage is obviously a work in progress, so check back for updates!
            </p>

          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p id="summary">Programmer in the New York/New Jersey area focusing on software and backend development</p>
            <p class="basic-info">
              I am an undergraduate student at Drew University studying math, phyics, and copmuter science. I also enjoy foreign language, particularly French, Spanish, and a little bit of German. In my free time I play the guitar and violin. I play classical violin and jazz guitar. Some of my musical influences are Warren Haynes, Derek Trucks, Doc Watson, and Stanley Turrentine.
            </p>
            <p class="basic-info">
              My first programming language was Python. During the summer of 2017 started teaching myself to code in Python. I took to the language and quickly started developing my own text-based programs. That fall, I took an intro course in Java, and expanded my computer science knowledge exponentially. In 2018, I will be completing a minor in computer science at Drew, and in the Fall, I hope to pursue a master's degree in the field.
            </p>
