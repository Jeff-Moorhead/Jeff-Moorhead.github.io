# Jeff-Moorhead.github.io - My Portfolio Page

This project is my personal portfolio page. It is aimed to display the work that I have done as a developer, including front-end projects, such as Local Weather, or Quote Machine, back-end oriented projects like Moorhead Bicycle, or CLI apps created in Python, like Autobackup. You can view my portfolio page hosted on Github Pages [here](https://jeff-moorhead.github.io).

The portfolio page itself serves as an example of the work I have done as a front-end developer. The project is built with plain-old HTML and CSS, but also makes use of Bootstrap to give it a more professional feel. You will find professional looking features, such as wells, a page header with a logo designed by my friend, Jackie Rapport (see more of her work [here](https://jacklynrapport.com)), and cards that link directly to either the project's Github repository or to the project itself hosted on Github Pages. Overall, my portfolio gives a powerful representation of what I am capable of as a developer. I welcome you to explore my portfolio and to reach out to me through email, LinkedIn, or Github with your feedback!
