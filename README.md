#Jeff-Moorhead.github.io - My Portfolio Page

This project is my personal portfolio page. It is aimed to display the work that I have done as a developer, including  
front-end projects, such as Local Weather, or Quote Machine, back-end oriented projects like Moorhead Bicycle, or CLI apps  
created in Python, like Autobackup.  
</br>
The portfolio page itself serves as an example of the work I have done as a front-end developer. The project is built with  
plain-old HTML and CSS, but also makes use of Bootstrap to give it a more professional feel. I welcome you to explore my  
portfolio and to reach out to me through email, LinkedIn, or Github with your feedback!
