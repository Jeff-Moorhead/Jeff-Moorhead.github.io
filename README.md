# Jeff-Moorhead.github.io - My Portfolio Page

This project is my personal portfolio page. It is aimed to display the work that I have done as a developer, including  
front-end projects, such as Local Weather, or Quote Machine, back-end oriented projects like Moorhead Bicycle, or CLI apps  
created in Python, like Autobackup.  
</br>
The portfolio page itself serves as an example of the work I have done as a front-end developer. The project is built with  
plain-old HTML and CSS, but also makes use of Bootstrap to give it a more professional feel. You will find professional-looking features, such as wells, a page header with a logo designed by my friend, Jackie Rapport, and cards that link directly to either the project's Github repository or to the project itself hosted on Github Pages. Overall, my portfolio gives a powerful representation of what I am capable of as a developer. I welcome you to explore my  
portfolio and to reach out to me through email, LinkedIn, or Github with your feedback!
